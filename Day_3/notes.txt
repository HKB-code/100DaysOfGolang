⚡ Compile Time vs Runtime (Clear & Practical):

🛠️ Compile time:
This is the phase when your source code is translated into machine code (or bytecode).
It happens before the program runs.
✅ What happens at compile time?
- Syntax checking (missing semicolons, wrong types)
- Type checking
- Code optimization
- Generating the executable or bytecode
✅ Compile-time errors include:
- Syntax errors
- Type mismatch
- Missing files
- Incorrect function signatures
🖥️ Example:
var x int  = "hello";  // compile-time error
✅ Key idea:
The compiler refuses to run your program until all compile-time errors are fixed.




🚀 Runtime
This is when the compiled program is executed.
✅ What happens at runtime?
- Memory allocation
- User input handling
- File/network access
- Dynamic behavior
- Exceptions
✅ Runtime errors include:
- Null pointer dereference
- Division by zero
- Out-of-bounds access
- File not found
- Network failure
🖥️ Example:
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    a := 10
    b := 0

    fmt.Println(a / b) // runtime panic: integer divide by zero
}
✅ Key idea:
-Runtime errors occur only when the program is actually running—the compiler cannot detect them
If you run this, Go will compile fine (no compile-time error), but at runtime it will panic with something like:
panic: runtime error: integer divide by zero

🧩 Comparison:
1.Compile Time:
-when it happens: before execution
-who handles it: compiler
-errors: syntax, type error
-memory: mostly stack/static
-examples: missing semicolon

2.Runtime:
-when it happens: during execution
-who handles it: cpu + os
-errors: exceptions, crashes 
-memory: heap, dynamic allocation
-examples: null pointer, divide by zero




🧠 A Simple Analogy
Think of writing a book:
- Compile time = Editor checks grammar, spelling, structure
- Runtime = Readers actually read the book and encounter issues like missing pages or plot holes

If you want, I can also explain:
✅ compile-time vs runtime polymorphism
✅ compile-time vs runtime memory
✅ compile-time vs runtime binding
