📝 Key Notes on Go Packages & File

# Imports
- Standard library: fmt
- Custom/local packages: example.com/fileOps
- Third-party modules: github.com/pallinder/go-randomdata

# Running Files
- go run . → runs all .go files in the current folder (same package).
- go run main.go → runs only that file; helpers won’t be included unless compiled together.

# Package Rules
- One package per folder → ✅ allowed.
- Multiple packages in the same folder → ❌ not allowed.
- All files in a folder must declare the same package name

# - File Naming
- Files can have any name (main.go, helper.go, utils.go).
- Names don’t need to match the package name. 

#  Main Package
- Must contain func main().
- Represents an executable program.
- Typically resides in the root folder.

# Subfolders
- Each package should live in its own subfolder.
- Example:
project/
├── main.go          // package main
└── fileops/
    └── ops.go       // package fileops

# Package vs Folder Name
- Folder name and package name don’t have to be the same.
- Best practice: keep them the same for clarity.
- Import path uses folder name, not package name.
