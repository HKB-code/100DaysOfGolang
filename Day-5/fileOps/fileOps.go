/*
In Go, error handling is designed to prevent application crashes, unlike some languages where errors can abruptly terminate the program. For example, the os.ReadFile function doesn't crash the app if a file is not found; instead, it returns an error alongside an empty byte slice ([]byte). This empty slice is converted to an empty string, which, when parsed as a float64, results in a value of 0.0. Unlike languages that rely on try-catch blocks to handle exceptions, Go encourages explicit error checking. Functions are written to return errors as values, allowing developers to handle them gracefully without crashing the application. This approach promotes robust and predictable error management, ensuring the program continues running even when issues like missing files occur.

/*
Multiple Packages in Same Folder: Not allowed in Go. Each package must be in its own subfolder.
Package Subfolder: Create a subfolder for each package, named after the package (e.g., fileops for a package named fileops).
File Naming: Files within the package folder can have any name; they donâ€™t need to match the package name.
Main Package: Typically resides in the root or its own subfolder (e.g., main). Each main package represents an executable program.
