why Go?
-> It was start creating in 2006 that was a really important time period.
That's an important, important year in computer science because in 2005, the first dual core processors

became widely available and were released by Intel.

And up until that point in time, there were no programming languages that existed that could natively

and easily take advantage of multiple cores.

And so Go was built to natively and easily run concurrent code in a parallel fashion on multiple cores.

And so there can be confusion about the difference between concurrency and parallelism.

So concurrency is a design pattern.

You write computer code with concurrency design patterns, right?

So this is code that's written with concurrency design patterns.

And then when you run that code on machines with multiple cores, that code can run in parallel.

So you have concurrency which are design patterns, and you have parallelism, which is running code

on multiple on computers, multiple cores in parallel.

So concurrency and parallelism.


->And up until that point in time, they said all other languages could allow you to have two of those,

but never all three.

So they wanted all three of those.
->efficient compilation
->efficient execution
-> ease of programming
